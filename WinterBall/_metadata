  "description" : "[h1]Read everything carefully, please! [/h1]\nThis mod is for the 1.4 version of Starbound. \nThis mod works off of the distortion ball tech acquired from the outpost. \n\n[u]The mod includes the following functions: [/u]\n-Sits \n-Rotations \n-Resizing (with size saving/recalling)\n-NoClip \n-Target Blink\n\nAlong with the tech functions, it also includes retextures for the human eyes. \nI believe the name of the texture mod was Ningen Human Replacer.\n\n[u]The keybindings for the functions are: [/u]\n'Special 1 + jump' to reset scaling/rotation and use the distortion ball. \n'Special 1 + up' to toggle no-clip. \n'Special 1 + down' to target blink. \n'Special 2' + 'walk' to sit or stand (tap to toggle).\n*During sit you can move your position like you normally would.​\n'Special 2' + 'up' to save a size value\n'Special 2' + 'down' to recall a size value\n'Special 3 + up/down' to scale player size. \n'Special 3 + left/right' to rotate. \n\n[i]Note:[/i]\n During no-clip mode, holding the 'walk' button will allow you to slow your no-clip to 0.5x speed.\nDuring rotation, you can hold the 'walk' button to slow the rotation speed.\nLastly, you can only save one size value per character.\n\n[u]Also, Animated Mugs are included in the mod. [/u]\nHowever, it requires a bit of modding knowledge to create a custom one. \nThe detailed instructions are in the mod file named: \"MugSpawn.txt\" \n\nAlternatively, you can spawn in a normal mug by going into the hand crafting menu. \nNote: this is a scripted item do not drop this on anyone without the mod! \n\n[b][i]Please note:[/i][/b]\n The function keys for the Special 2 and Special 3 were removed in Starbound 1.0.\n So I made a patch to put the bindings back in the control menu.\n You need to rebind the keys before trying to use the functions. \n Also, Special 1 is named \"ActivateHeadTech\" by default.\n Go to the control menu and at the bottom of the player menu the keybindings will be found there. \n\nI will likely be adding more functions to the mod so, suggestions are always welcome. \nAlso, if any bugs or issues pop up while using the mod, please inform me of the issue.",
